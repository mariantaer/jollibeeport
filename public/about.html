         <h2>More than 45 years of sharing the Joy!</h2>
      <p>
        What began as an ice cream parlor in 1975 has grown into the largest fast-food chain in the Philippines and a beloved brand worldwide.
        Jollibee Foods Corporation was founded by Tony Tan Caktiong and his family, who transformed their humble ice cream business into a global phenomenon.
